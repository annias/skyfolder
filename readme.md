# JollyFolder

**A Barebones program to quickly share a folder over the network.**

JollyFolder enables you to quickly and easily spin up a self-contained HTTP server to share files. Designed for busy people that don't want to remember how to configure anything. Ships with good defaults and includes a built-in management GUI to quickly check the boxes on exactly what features you want.

### Project goals:
- Security, should be safe to expose to the open internet
- Minimal config with good defaults -- No need to memorize crap or fiddle with CLI flags
- Management GUI that generates TOML for you in the background (not required, you can edit the TOML yourself)
- "Just works" -- uses all CPU cores, supports partial files and retries, generates thumbnails, supports directories with thousands of files
- Minimal code surface
